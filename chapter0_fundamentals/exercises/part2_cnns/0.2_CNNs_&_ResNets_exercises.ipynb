On the other hand, the **universal approximation theorem** tells us that we can approximate any continuous function using a sufficiently large neural network, if we use nonlinear activation functions. It's worth emphasizing that the theory of the UAT and what networks look like in practice are very different - in particular, many versions of the UAT are based on a shallow but extremely wide neural network, on the other hand most of the power of modern neural networks comes from their ability to compose between layers: feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, and create increasingly expressive functions.

        "The `torchvision` package consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision, and `torchvision.transforms` provides access to a suite of functions for preprocessing data. We define a transform for the MNIST data (which is applied to each image in the dataset) by composing `ToTensor` (which converts a `PIL.Image` object into a PyTorch tensor) and `Normalize` (which takes arguments for the mean and standard deviation, and performs the linear transformation `x -> (x - mean) / std`). For the latter, we use `0.1307` and `0.3081` which are the empirical mean & std of the raw data (so after this transformation, the data will have mean 0 and variance 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we define our datasets using `torchvision.datasets`. The first argument tells us where to save our data to (so that when we run this in the future we won't have to re-save it), and `transform=MNIST_TRANSFORM` tells us that we should apply our previously defined `transform` to each element in our dataset. We also use `Subset` which allows us to return a slice of the dataset rather than the whole thing (because our model won't need much data to train!).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, since our dataset only allows for iteration over individual datapoints, we wrap it in `DataLoader` which enables iteration over **batches**. It also provides useful arguments like `shuffle`, which determine whether we randomize the order after each epoch. The code above demonstrates iteration over the dataset & dataloader respectively, showing how the first element in the dataloader's first batch equals the first element in the dataset (note that this wouldn't be true for the training set, because we've shuffled it).\n",

The truth is a bit more complicated, and some studies dispute whether it actually saves time, so at this point it's more of a standard convention than a hard rule which will always lead to more efficient training.\n",

While training our model, we differentiate with respect to the average loss over all samples in the batch (so a smaller batch usually means the loss is more noisy). However, if you're working with large models, then often having a batch size too large will result in a memory error. This will be relevant for models later on in the course, but for now we're working with very small models so this isn't an issue.\n",

This helper function used `torchvision.datasets.MNIST` to load in data, and then (optionally) the `torch.utils.data.Subset` function to return a subset of this data. Don't worry about the details of this function, it's not the kind of thing you'll need to know by heart.\n",

Adam is generally the most popular and seen as the most effective in the majority of cases. We'll discuss optimizers in more detail tomorrow, but for now it's enough to understand that the optimizer calculates the amount to update parameters by (as a function of those parameters' gradients, and sometimes other inputs), and performs this update step. The first argument passed to our optimizer is the parameters of our model (because these are the values that will be updated via gradient descent), and you can also pass keyword arguments to the optimizer which change its behaviour (e.g. the learning rate).\n",

Another advantage of using them is autocompletion: when you type in `args.` in VSCode, you'll get a dropdown of all your different dataclass attributes, which can be useful when you've forgotten what you called a variable!\n",

        "> It is very important that you understand training loops and how they work, because we'll be doing a lot of model training in this way.\n",

        "Edit the `train` function above to include a validation loop. Train your model, making sure you measure the accuracy at the end of each epoch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few tips to help you:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You'll need a dataloader for the testset, just like we did for the trainset. It doesn't matter whether you shuffle the testset or not, because we're not updating our model parameters during validation (we usually set `shuffle=False` for testsets).\n",
        "    * You can set the same batch size as for your training set (we'll discuss more optimal choices for this later in the course).\n",
        "* During the validation step, you should be measuring **accuracy**, which is defined as **the fraction of correctly classified images**.\n",
        "    * Note that (unlike loss) accuracy should only be logged after you've gone through the whole validation set. This is because your model doesn't update between computing different accuracies, so it doesn't make sense to log all of them separately.\n",
        "    * Computing accuracy is meant to be a very short operation, so you shouldn't need a progress bar.\n",
        "    * You can wrap your forward pass in `with t.inference_mode():` to make sure that your model is in inference mode during validation (i.e. gradients don't propagate)."

        "A convolution is an operation which takes a kernel and slides it across the input, applying the kernel to each patch of the input. We can view it as a logical extension of the linear layer, except rather than having every output value being determined as a linear combination of every input value, we have a **prior of locality** - assuming that the input has some spatial structure, and each output value should only be determined by a small patch of the input.

Note that we use all input channels when computing each output value, which means the sumproduct is over `kernel_length * in_channels` elements (or `kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels` when, as is most often the case, we're using 2D kernels)."

It has all conv parameters default i.e. `kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1` except for the stride which is instead given by `first_stride`. The second convolution has all default parameters, and maps from `out_feats` to `out_feats` (meaning it's fully shape preserving).\n",

        "As for the **right branch** - this is meant to essentially be a skip connection, the problem is we can't just use a skip connection because the shapes might not match up (and so we couldn't add them together at the end). The left branch is fully shape preserving if and only if `first_stride == 1` and `in_feats == out_feats`. If this is true then we do set the right branch to be the identity (that's what the \"OPTIONAL\" annotation refers to), but if this isn't true then we set the right branch to be a 1x1 convolution with stride `first_stride`, zero padding, and mapping from `in_feats` to `out_feats`, followed by a batchnorm layer. This is in a sense the simplest operation we can get which matches the left branch shape, since the convolution is basically just a downsampling operation (keeping pixels based on a `::first_stride` slice across the height and width dimensions)."

        "**Finetuning** can mean slightly different things in different contexts, but broadly speaking it means using the weights of an already trained network as the starting values for training a new network. Because training networks from scratch is very computationally expensive, this is a common practice in ML.\n",
        "\n",
        "The specific type of finetuning we'll be doing here is called **feature extraction**. This is when we freeze most layers of a model except the last few, and perform gradient descent on those. We call this feature extraction because the earlier layers of the model have already learned to identify important features of the data (and these features are also relevant for the new task), so all that we have to do is train a few final layers in the model to extract these features.\n",

        "*Terminology note - sometimes feature extraction and finetuning are defined differently, with finetuning referring to the training of all the weights in a pretrained model (usually with a small or decaying learning rate), and feature extraction referring to the freezing of some layers and training of others. To avoid confusion here, we'll use the term \"feature extraction\" rather than \"finetuning\".*\n",

When we call `loss.backward()` in our training loop (or when this is implicitly called by our PyTorch Lightning trainer), this propagates gradients from our `loss` scalar back to all parameters in our model. If a parameter has its `requires_grad` attribute set to `False`, it means gradients won't be computed for this tensor during backpropagation. Thanks to PyTorch helpfully keeping track of the parameters which require gradients (using a structure called the **computational graph**), if we set `requires_grad = False` for the first few layers of parameters in our model, PyTorch will actually save us time and compute by not calculating gradients for these parameters at all.\n",
